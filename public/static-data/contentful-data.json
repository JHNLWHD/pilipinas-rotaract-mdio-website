      "description": "Rotaract District 3770, a vital segment of Rotary International, serves the eastern and northern regions of Luzon in the Philippines. This district encompasses provinces such as Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Nueva Vizcaya, Isabela, Cagayan, Ifugao, Quirino, Kalinga-Apayao, Batanes, and Baler. Originally part of District 3800, which included Rotary clubs north of the Pasig River, District 3770 was officially established during the 1987-88 Rotary year when District 3800 was divided into three separate districts. Since its inception, Rotaract District 3770 has been dedicated to fostering leadership, professional development, and community service among young adults. The district comprises numerous Rotaract clubs, each actively engaging in projects that address the unique needs of their communities. These clubs operate under the guidance and support of their sponsoring Rotary clubs, working collaboratively to implement initiatives that promote positive change.\n\nIn the current Rotary year, 2024-2025, the district is under the leadership of District Rotaract Representative (DRR) Ralph Bernardo. DRR Bernardo has articulated a clear vision aimed at enhancing the district’s impact and reach. His strategic goals for the year focus on\nstrengthening membership engagement, enhancing leadership development, expanding community service initiatives, promoting public image and awareness, and fostering partnerships and collaborations. He emphasizes the importance of active participation among members and aims to increase membership retention by fostering a sense of belonging and purpose within the clubs. Recognizing the potential of Rotaractors as future leaders, he is committed to providing comprehensive training programs designed to equip members with essential skills and knowledge for leadership roles within and beyond the organization. Under DRR Bernardo’s guidance, the district also plans to broaden the scope of its service projects by identifying and addressing pressing community issues through sustainable and impactful initiatives. To attract new members and garner support for various projects,he has launched efforts to enhance the public image of Rotaract District 3770. This involves leveraging social media platforms and other communication channels to highlight the district’s activities and achievements. Additionally, building strong relationships with external organizations, local governments, and other Rotary and Rotaract clubs is a priority. These partnerships aim to amplify the district’s efforts and resources, leading to more effective service delivery. \n\nA testament to the district’s commitment to these goals was the successful Mid-Year Review held recently, which featured the Mid-Year Awards recognizing the outstanding efforts of various clubs and individuals. During this event, DRR Bernardo also delivered the State of the District Address, highlighting achievements and outlining future goals. Through these concerted efforts, Rotaract District 3770 continues to empower young leaders, foster community development, and uphold the values of Rotary International. The district remains steadfast in its mission to create positive and lasting change within its communities, guided by the vision and leadership of DRR Ralph Bernardo.\n\nLIST OF ACTIVE ROTARACT CLUBS\n\n1.

      "description": "Rotaract, one of Rotary International's most dynamic service programs, boasts a global reach with over 7,000 clubs in 163 countries. In the Philippines, the Rotaract journey began in 1972 with the establishment of the Rotaract Club of Adamson University, sponsored by the Rotary Club of Manila—the first Rotary club in Asia. This paved the way for the creation of many more Rotaract clubs across the country.\n\nInitially part of District 380, which encompassed all clubs in Luzon, significant re-districting shaped the regions:\n\n- 1977-1978: District 380 was divided, creating District 3820. This included Southern Metro Manila, Southern Tagalog, Bicol Region, Mindoro, Palawan, and Marinduque.\n- 1985-1986: District 3820 was further split, forming District 3810, covering Manila (south of Pasig River), Cavite, Palawan, and Mindoro.\n- 1999-2000: District 3810 was restructured, birthing District 3830, which now oversees Makati, Las Piñas, Parañaque, Taguig, Pateros, Palawan, and Oriental Mindoro. District 3810 retained Manila, Pasay, Cavite, and Occidental Mindoro.\n\nDespite these changes, Rotaract clubs in District 3810 thrived, excelling in service and leadership:\n\n- Service Excellence: Clubs are celebrated for impactful projects like \"Gift of Learning\" by the Rotaract Club of Manila, recognized as the Asia-Pacific Regional Winner.\n- Leadership in Action: Rotaractors in the district have actively contributed to regional and international initiatives, including the Asia Pacific Regional Rotaract Conference (2006-2007) hosted under PDRR Rhosenie Villanueva.\n- Global Participation: Members have engaged in programs like the Rotary Foundation’s Group Study Exchange, showcasing the district's commitment to global collaboration.\n\nToday, District 3810 stands as a beacon of innovation, collaboration, and service, fostering leaders and initiatives that inspire change across the Asia-Pacific and beyond.\n\nLIST OF ACTIVE ROTARACT CLUBS\n\n1.

With a heart for public service and a mind sharpened by experience, John stands today as the Chairperson of the Pilipinas Rotaract Multi-District Information Organization—leading the nation’s premier platform for collaboration and innovation among Rotaract clubs in the Philippines.\n\nA proud graduate of Lyceum of the Philippines University – Manila with a degree in Foreign Service, Major in Diplomacy, John continues to pursue excellence through graduate studies in Public Management at the University of the Philippines – Open University. His academic journey is marked not only by scholarly pursuits but by a commitment to make governance work for the people.\n\nHis leadership extends far beyond the classroom. John has served at the heart of Philippine policymaking—as Deputy Party List Manager under Congresswoman Marissa “Del Mar” Magsino and as a Political Affairs Officer under the distinguished Senator Richard J. Gordon. Recognized early on for his leadership potential, he was awarded the Gerry Roxas Leadership Award—a reflection of the impact he continues to make.\n\nBut it is in Rotaract where John’s passion truly found its purpose.\n\nFrom his beginnings as President of the Rotaract Club of South Signal Village, he quickly rose as a transformational leader. Under his guidance, the club garnered multiple awards across all avenues of service, including gold, silver, and bronze distinctions for its impactful programs. His excellence in leadership earned him the rare honor of being appointed District Secretary of Rotaract District 3830 for two consecutive terms—proof of his consistency, credibility, and character.\n\nIn 2017, John made history. Not only was he elected as President of the LPU English Club—the university’s largest student organization—but he also became the first elected District Rotaract Representative-Nominee and, later, the youngest District Rotaract Representative of RI District 3830. At just 22, he led 71 clubs across Metro Manila and Palawan, setting a new standard for youth-led governance in Rotary.\n\nAfter his trailblazing term, he co-founded the Rotaract Club of Taguig—the first in his district and one of only two in the country without a sponsoring Rotary club. This bold and barrier-breaking move united seasoned leaders from four different clubs, proving that collaboration—not structure—creates impact.\n\nJohn’s journey in Pilipinas Rotaract MDIO is equally inspiring. From a Learning and Development Associate to Deputy Chief for Policy and Process Improvement, to a two-term Treasurer—and now, Chairperson—he has embodied the MDIO’s mission to connect, empower, and elevate Filipino Rotaractors. Under his leadership, the MDIO continues to champion excellence, innovation, and unity across all districts nationwide.\n\nMore than his titles, it is John’s humility, vision, and authenticity that define him. He reminds us that age is not a limitation, that service is not about status, and that leadership is not about being in front—but being for others.\n\nJohn Philip Chan is not just a leader of today—he is a catalyst for tomorrow, and a living example of what’s possible when passion meets purpose in the spirit of “Service Above Self.”",
