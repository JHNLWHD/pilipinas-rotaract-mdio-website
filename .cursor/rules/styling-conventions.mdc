# Styling Conventions

This document outlines the styling conventions used in the Pilipinas Rotaract MDIO 53 project.

## TailwindCSS

- [tailwind.config.ts](mdc:tailwind.config.ts) contains the project's Tailwind configuration
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling whenever possible
- Avoid inline CSS styles and traditional CSS files

## Class Naming

- Use consistent class naming for components
- For conditional classes, prefer the following syntax:
  ```tsx
  className={`
    base-classes 
    ${condition ? 'active-class' : 'inactive-class'}
  `}
  ```

## Theme Variables

- Use theme variables defined in tailwind.config.ts
- Color scheme should follow the project's design system
- Maintain consistent spacing, sizing, and typography

## Component Styling

- Keep styling logic within component files
- For complex components, consider using Tailwind's @apply directive in a separate CSS file
- Use responsive classes for different screen sizes (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.)

## Dark Mode

- Use Tailwind's dark mode utility for dark mode support
- Example: `className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800"`

## Accessibility

- Ensure proper color contrast for text and interactive elements
- Use appropriate text sizes for readability
- Support keyboard navigation and focus states
