        <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-700">
          <p>It has always been a dream for the Philippine District Rotaract Representatives (DRRs) to establish a Multi-District Information Organization ever since. There were numerous generations of DRRs who tried to create such an organization. But that dream had just begun to realize when the Philippine Rotaract was given a chance to host the 3rd Asia Pacific Regional Rotaract Conference (APRRC) in 2006. During that time, the DRRs worked as one as they met various challenges while planning and preparing for the important event. The successful hosting of APRRC Pilipinas became the strongest force that made the Philippine MDIO into a reality.</p>
          <p>On February 4, 2007, the first meeting for the formation was held in Rotary Club of Cubao Resource and Learning Center in Araneta Center, Cubao, Quezon City. It was then that the Memorandum of Understanding, By-laws and Constitution were deliberated by then DRRs Devie Ontolan (D3780), Rhosenie Villanueva (D3810), Felimon Brazas Jr. (D3820) and Maria Beth Salvador (D3790). All ten Philippine Rotaract districts contributed and were involved in different ways. Even the farthest DRRs Karlene Lariosa (D3860) and Arnold Gapusan (D3870) were actively involved with online revisions of By-Laws and Constitution. The logo was made by DRR Ardel Buenconsejo (D3850) who is an architect by profession. Truly, the 10 Philippine Rotaract districts joined hands for Pilipinas MDIO application.</p>
          <p>The original set of officers was as follows: Chairman DRR Devie Ontolan (D3780), Secretary DRR Filemon Brazas Jr. (D3820), Asst. Secretary DRR Joanie Sitoy (D3830), Treasurer DRR Maria Elizabeth Salvador (D3790), Public Relations Committee Chair DRR Dimple De Silva (D3770) and its Vice Chair DRR Catherine Deang (D3800). Assigned for the Training and Professional Development Committee were DRR Rhosenie Villanueva (D3810) as Chair and DRR Joanie Sitoy (D3830) as its Vice Chair.</p>
          <p>There were five districts that tried to submit the MDIO requirements on June 24, 2007 to Rotary International (RI) for inclusion and recognition. However, only three districts complied with all the requirements. It was on November 26, 2007 when RI responded that the General Secretary, on behalf of the RI Board, has approved the request from Districts 3780, 3810 and 3820 to form MDIO.</p>
          <p>However, to keep within current RI naming guidelines, the approval is contingent upon MDIO's acceptance of the revised name "Pilipinas Rotaract MDIO representing Districts 3780, 3810 and 3820" and providing guidelines and bylaws to RI which reflect the changed name. Past RI Committee Director Tom Panis and PDG Sonny Coloma (Zone Coordinator for Youth Resources Group of RI) were the two Filipino RI officers who eagerly helped follow-up the MDIO application status.</p>
          <p>On Rotary Year 2008-09, Districts 3790 and 3830 were able to complete the requirements and were included as members. Then, Districts 3800 and 3860 pursue their membership applications in Rotary Year 2009-10 and were immediately recognized by RI. Only in Rotary Year 2012-13 when the remaining three districts (Districts 3770, 3850 and 3870) were approved and recognized by RI to join the MDIO. Thus, the time to use the name "Pilipinas Rotaract MDIO".</p>
